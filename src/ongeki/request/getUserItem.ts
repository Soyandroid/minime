   * This is an odd amalgam of what ought to be two separate `kind` and

   * The quotient is the `kind` that the client wants you to return, the
   * remainder is the effective `nextIndex` pagination cookie which comes into
   * play if more than `maxCount` items of this type are available. Presumably
   * returning a result set of size `maxCount` will cause another request to
   * be issued in order to retrieve the next page. See response documentation
   * for further details.
