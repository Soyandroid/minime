   * - If further records are available then return `kind` * `G` + `cookie`,
   *   where
   *    - `kind` is the `UserItemJson.kind` value extracted from the request
   *    - `G` is ten billion (smallest power of ten greater than 2**32)
   *    - `cookie` is probably any 32-bit integer context value you want
   *
